Create a postgreSQL query from the json. Where I want to insert into the state
, district, and taluka. Below are the fields from json which we will insert into table.

The tables are:
1. State: name, country (fk) (default = 1)
2. District: name, state (fk)
3. Taluka: name, district (fk)


The json fields which correspond to table fields are (table_field: json_key):
1. State:
    id: state_code
    name: state_name_english
    country: 1 (this is default value)

2. District:
    id: district_code
    name: district_name_english
    state: state_code

3. Taluka:
    id: subdistrict_code
    name: subdistrict_name_english
    district: district_code
